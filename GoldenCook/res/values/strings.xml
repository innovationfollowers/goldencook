					Following is the thread test (tar) to check required consistency of syrup (chashni). If no thread is formed, but there is
					stickiness in the syrup when tested, then it is 3/4 tar (thread). This consistency is generally used in dipping sweets like,
					gulabjamoon, boondi, jalebi, imarti, etc. Boil some more and when 1 tar forms, it is used in soaking pancake pancakes like
					malpua. On further boiling two tars are obtained and this is used in sweets like burfis, mohanthal, etc. At this stage a drop
					of syrup dropped on a plate will form a soft ball when cooled. After this stage do no stir briskly and continuously or the
					sugar will recrystallise. Still further boiling will form 2 1/2 to 3 tars and this syrup is used to get a white coating of sugar on
					sweets like balushahi, surti ghari, etc. At this stage when the syrup is dropped in a plate it will form a hard ball when
					cooled. Following are the steps shown to make sugar syrup (chashni) in the right way.\n
					a.Take sugar and water in the ratio of 2 : 1 1/2 unless other wise mentioned.\n
					b.Put both in a deep saucepan to boil, stirring occasionally.\n
					c.When the mixture comes to a boil, add 1/2 cup milk.\n
					d.When a thick scum is formed on the surface of syrup, it is time to strain.\n
					e.Always use a metal strainer or moist cloth to strain the hot syrup, never plas tic.\n
					f.Put back to boil, checking the consistency required as above.\n
					g.Check frequently, because once the first thread forms, it proceeds to thicken to the next stages very quickly.\n
					h.Use as required in the recipe. Make syrup side by side of making the recipe, reheating the syrup too many times will alter
					the texture of the resulting sweet dish. To save time, prepare the syrup on a second burner, while making the rest of the
					recipe. This will avoid excess wastage of time and unnecessary cooling off, of the fried flours, etc. as the recipe demands.</string>

	· 3 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter)	\n
	· 1 medium onion - finely chopped	\n
	· 4 cloves garlic - peeled and sliced	\n
	· 1.5 inch piece root ginger - peeled and thinly sliced (it should look about the same volume as the garlic)	\n
	· (optional) 2 mild fleshy green chillies - de-seeded and veined then chopped	\n
	· half teaspoon turmeric powder	\n
	· half teaspoon ground cumin seed	\n
	· half teaspoon ground coriander seed	\n
	· 5 tablespoons plain passata (smooth, thick, sieved tomatoes, US = purée) or 1 tablespoon concentrated tomato	\n
	purée (US = paste) mixed with 4 tablespoons water	\n
	</string>
	<string name="Catagory3_Method79">
	Heat the oil in a heavy pan then add the chopped onion and stir for a few minutes with the heat on high.	\n
	Add the ginger, garlic and green chilli (if using). Stir for 30 seconds then put the heat down to very low.	\n
	Cook for 15 minutes stirring from time to time making sure nothing browns or burns.	\n
	Add the turmeric, cumin and coriander and cook, still very gently, for a further 5 minutes. Don\'t burn the spices or the	\n
	sauce will taste horrid - sprinkle on a few drops of water if you\'re worried.	\n
	Take off the heat and cool a little. Put 4 fl oz cold water in a blender, add the contents of the pan and whizz until very	\n
	smooth. Add the passata and stir.	\n
	Put the puréed mixture back into the pan and cook for 20 - 30 minutes (the longer the better) over very low heat stirring	\n
	occasionally. You can add a little hot water if it starts to catch on the pan but the idea is to gently "fry" the sauce	\n
	which will darken in colour to an orangy brown. The final texture should be something like good tomato ketchup.	\n
	Warning - it WILL gloop occasionally and splatter over your cooker, it\'s the price you have to pay!	\n

In a large bowl,combine the chapati atta , rice flour,  \n

1 tablespoon garlic/ginger paste, 1 tsp chilli powder,  \n

Mix well with water, till you get the consistency of    \n

deep fry in oil, drain and set aside.   \n
In a open pan, add some oil and when it smokes  \n
add the remaining garlic and ginger paste.      \n
The minute it starts turning brown, add the chopped     \n
onions and fry only till they start becoming    \n
translucent.    \n
Now add the chopped garlic and green chilli paste       \n
and fry for a minute.   \n

on low heat and when the mixture turns thick enough,    \n
add the chopped corainder leaves and stir for 20 seconds.       \n
